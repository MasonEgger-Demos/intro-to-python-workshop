this list. If you have a resource you want me to add, submit a PR!*

## Beginner Resources 

* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
    * *Anything Al Sweigart writes is pure gold. I always recommend Automate
    the Boring Stuff with Python as an introductory book since it covers the 
    essentials of Python as well as provide projects that everyone can benefit
    from that show the benefits of programming right away.*

## Intermediate/Advanced Resource

* [Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1491946008)
    * *Fluent Python is considered a de-facto standard for learning the more
    nitty gritty parts of Python. Whenever someone asks me "I feel I have the 
    basics of Python down, what's a good resource for intermediate to expert
    level Python?" I always answer Fluent Python*

## Web Resources

* [Python Website](https://www.python.org/)
    * *The Python language website is a great resource for finding news, docs,
    jobs, conferences and much more regarding the Python community.*
* [Real Python Tutorials](https://realpython.com)
    * *Real Python covers tutorials about virtually everything you could ever want
    to do in Python. It is an excellent resource for not only learning Python concepts,
    but building Python projects.*
