# Introduction to Python Workshop

This is a series of courses on the Python programming language. This is, in no
way, a complete representation on all things Python. There are so many amazing
topics to cover, many of which I'm not qualified to talk about, that there is 
no way I could get to them all. 



## Pre Workshop Setup

### Linux or Mac
1. Ensure that the latest version of Python 3 is installed on your machine.
2. You may want to install a text editor, such as PyCharm or VSCode, on your 
machine.
3. Creating a Google account (gmail) isn't required but strongly encouraged.

### Windows
1. You'll need to setup WSL. Follow the instructions in [this blog post](https://mason.dev/blog/year_of_linux_desktop/)
2. The blog post covers installing VSCode and setting it up with WSL.
3. Creating a Google account (gmail) isn't required but strongly encouraged.

*Yes, Python can be installed normally on Windows. For the sake of this tutorial
we're going to use the WSL*

### Work in Progress
This workshop is still a work in progress and many of the sections aren't
done yet. Thanks for your patience. :smile:

### Contributions
I will happily accept contributions to this repo that I find useful. This may
not be the way you decide to teach Python and that's all right. I'm always open
for pedagogical discussions and love having them, but at the end of the day it is
ultimately my decision. This is nothing against your contributions and I welcome
**ALL** feedback.
