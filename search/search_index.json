This is, in no way, a complete representation on all things Python. There are so many amazing topics to cover, many of which I'm not qualified to talk about, that there is no way I could get to them all. Pre Workshop Setup Linux or Mac Ensure that the latest version of Python 3 is installed on your machine. You may want to install a text editor, such as PyCharm or VSCode, on your machine. Creating a Google account (gmail) isn't required but strongly encouraged. Windows You'll need to setup WSL. Follow the instructions in this blog post The blog post covers installing VSCode and setting it up with WSL. Creating a Google account (gmail) isn't required but strongly encouraged. Yes, Python can be installed normally on Windows. For the sake of this tutorial we're going to use the WSL Miscellaneous Contact Info Twitter: @masonegger Website: mason.dev Discord Server: discord.masonegger.com Work in Progress This workshop is still a work in progress and many of the sections aren't done yet. Thanks for your patience. Contributions I will happily accept contributions to this repo that I find useful. This may not be the way you decide to teach Python and that's all right. I'm always open for pedagogical discussions and love having them, but at the end of the day it is ultimately my decision. This is nothing against your contributions and I welcome ALL feedback.
